###### What functionality does this code add?

###### Are there any lessons in this module I should revisit?

###### I have:

- [ ] Refactored for loops to use prototype methods instead
- [ ] Taken opportunities to refactor ES5 syntax to ES6
- [ ] Confirmed app has no breaking errors
- [ ] Resolved merge conflicts
